    <main>
      <p>The following example shows how scripts are included in an HTML document. Please see the code for details and comments. Open the JavaScript Console to see the results.</p>
    </main>


    <!--
      Scripts should be placed at the very end of an HTML document.
      This allows the page time to load before the script is put into
      action. Unless a library you are using specifies otherwise, place
      the script just before the closing body tag.

      Scripts can be written inside script tags within HTML or
      contained in another document and linked to.

      The following is an example of an embedded script:
    -->

    <script>
      console.log("Hello! This message is coming from HTML!");
    </script>

    <!--
      And below is an example of a linked script.

      (The name of your file - - script.js - - can be anything.)

      To keep your files organized, it is generally recommended to
      place scripts in a 'js' or 'scripts' folder.
    -->

    <script src="js/script.js"></script>

    <!--
      When to use what? If you are using a script on just one page, it
      would be okay to embed the script on the page. If the script will
      be used on multiple pages, link to the file.

      In some cases, you may need a mix of both.

      From a technical standpoint, how the script is includes should
      not necessarily make a difference.
