    <h1>Weather API (with Ajax)</h1>

    <p>Open the JavaScript Console to view National Weather Service API data.</p>

    <script>

      // The following code makes a call to an API using ajax (asynchronous
      // javascript). The request variable stores the XMLHttpRequest object,
      // which contains methods which allow us to 'talk' to other servers.

      var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

      // The url variable stores the URL of the API we are trying to access.
      // In this case, we must specify two parameters to the API to make it
      // return what we expect -- the airport code (i.e. FLL) and the format
      // of the data (json).

      var url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MFL/106,48/forecast/hourly";

      // The following is a function set up to act when the request takes
      // place and is successful (that's the simple way of putting it).
      // If the server has responded with an 'OK!' and sends the data, the
      // results (json) are parsed and stored in a variable which we can then
      // work with!

    request.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (request.readyState == 4 && request.status == 200) {
        var weather = JSON.parse(request.responseText);

        // We need to pass our data to a function which uses the data in
        // the variable airport and processes it to be displayed on the
        // page.

        // For now, let's make sure the data is being pulled in; we'll
        // use console.log to examine the data.

        console.log("*** All data pulled in from the API: ***");
        console.log(weather);
        console.log("*** Only the forecast data from the current hour: ***");
        console.log(weather.properties.periods[0])
      }
    }

    // We make our request to the server.

    request.open("GET", url, true);
    request.send();

    // Now we can work with the data!

    // We will need to gather the element ids to modify the HTML. We also
    // need to create a function called 'display' which takes one argument
    // (data) and processes the information.

    // Want to make your own weather widget? Below is some documentation
    // from National Weather Service about its API.
