          A note about the image:

          The original image in this example was 1.5MB. That is way too
          big for the dimensions it was fit into (300px). Never re-size
          an image using code. Even if it's coded to fit into 300px, a
          user will still be downloading every pixel of the 1.5MB
          image! That can slow the speed of the page, which makes for a
          bad user experience.

          The image was simply re-sized in photoshop, down from 2500px
          wide to 300px. The file size went from 1.5MB to 24kb! A HUGE
          difference! :)
