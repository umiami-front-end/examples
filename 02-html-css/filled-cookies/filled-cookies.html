        <!--
          Explanation behind the use of div:

          In order for the grid to work properly, two child elements
          are needed. Without the div, there would be three (h1, p,
          img). In this case, div is used to group h1 and p into
          their own box. The content is already grouped into header
          and isn't being described further (which is why a
          structural element, like section, is not used here) so div
          is entirely appropriate for this purpose.
