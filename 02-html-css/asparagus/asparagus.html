      This is a bit of a break from the original version. I don't want

          How an h1 and an h2? Think of the h2 in this case as a subhead.
          (Subheads are permitted at any level.) But moving forward, any
          heading we use would be one higher than the subhead.

          The above image can probably be smaller in both dimensions
          and file size, but it's not too bad ... so we let it be.

          Where this may be an issue is when we test the page by
          'breaking' the stylesheet. The photo is quite large.

            The original example used all table headings for the content;
            this is incorrect. Below is an example of a proper table.

            The issue with this design-wise is it leaves a chunk of
            unused whitespace to the right. It is probably possible to
            rework the content in the header to better balance out this
            part of the page, but without the original author's intent,
            I left it as-is to at least demonstrate proper use of a
            table.

            This takes us out of the comfort zone of applying a grid to
            structural tags. Anything can utilize grid layout. :)

            But this introduces a problem: When we change a list to
            display as a grid, the default bullets/increment disppear.
            We can fix this in CSS! (See style.css for details.)
